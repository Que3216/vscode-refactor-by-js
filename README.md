# Refactor by JS

An editor embedded in vscode for running javascript transformations in bulk over source files, with a live preview of the transformation result. Useful for complex refactors across large codebases.

## Development

Run:

```
yarn install
yarn run build
```

And then press F5 in vscode, and in the new vscode window that launches, run the `Refactor by JS` command.
